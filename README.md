# Deep-Face-Detector
This network is using VGG16 for transfer-learning. I have used 90 self-collected images and augmented the data to create about 4700 images. there are two loss functions which will be summed up as the total loss. in the end, real-time face detection and bounding-box-generation are implemented using open-cv.
